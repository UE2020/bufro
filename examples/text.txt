Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[12][13] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[14] but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.[15] Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.[16][17]

Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.[18][19] The designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine,[20] and the Rust compiler. It has gained increasing use in industry, and Microsoft has been experimenting with the language for secure and safety-critical software components.[21][22]

Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016, though only used by 7% of the respondents in the 2021 survey.[23]
